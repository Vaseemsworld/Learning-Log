# Learning-Log
A learning log is a personal record documenting learning experiences, goals, activities, and reflections over time. Users can create accounts to personalize their learning journey, make posts to document various learning experiences, and add entries to these posts. The flexibility extends to editing and deleting both posts and entries, allowing users to curate and refine their learning log over time.
